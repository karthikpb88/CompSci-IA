<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>CompSci-IA</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">A pubic archive of my computer science IA for the IB (M20). This repo contains code, documentation etc for reference purposes</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Computer Science IA</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In the IB, each subject you take is split into 2 main components:</span></p>
<ol class="ol1">
  <li class="li2"><span class="s1">Internal Assesment</span></li>
  <li class="li2"><span class="s1">External Assesment</span></li>
</ol>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The External Assesment is generally the written final-exams taken at the end of the IBDP program. For Computer Science, these include Paper 1, Paper 2 and Paper 3, consisting of about 80% of your final grade for HL students and 75% for SL students.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Internal Assesment covers the rest of your final grade. The CS IA in the IB is nicknamed ‘The Solution’. The name is quite self explanatory, as the IA expects students to design a ‘solution’ to a problem using skills acquired over the course of the program. The student must identify a client with a problem they believe that they can solve.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">There are 5 major steps involved in the undertaking of the Computer Science IA, detailed below:</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><b>Identification and Consultation:</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The first step is to find a client you are comfortable with and consult with them. Find a neighbour, relative (not parents or siblings) or someone you know well. You will be working with them extensively throught the development process, and knowing the person beforehand can help you get things started smoothly.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Talk to your client, ask him to describe certain aspects of his workflow and keep your mind open. The ‘solution’ doesn’t need you to solve a revolutionary problem that requires cutting-edge tech and experience. Even the most mundane sounding tasks can be spun out into a project. The end goal is to make a tool that your client would want to use. Try to think of a way to automate certain workflows by introduce digital tools. For example, my project aimed to speed up test taking in my clients workplace by digitising the test taking process. The previous method of handling tests was laborious as it required the tests to be printed, distributed and then graded - manually. My software allows a senior supervisor to make questions in software and digitally publish them so employees can take it at their leisure. It also automates grading, except for free response questions.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">It is important to take notes, preferably even record the entirety of the first discussion for future reference. In fact, documentation is a major part of the IA. The consultation section of your IA lies under </span><span class="s2"><b>Criterion A</b></span><span class="s1">. In this document, you will need to detail the issue your client is facing (Scenario), your rationale (what your proposed solution is and why it is the best approach), and the target goals that your project will meet as discussed with your client (success criteria). It is also highly recommended that you submit some form of proof of the discussion with your client. Transcribe the recording of your client interview (only key sections are necessary), and attach it in the appendix. Make sure to reference it in the footnotes of your Criterion A document.</span></p>
